            <h1>Eagle Lander</h1>
            <p>Apollo 11's lander was named the "Eagle" - and this is direct painting of a photograph of Neil Armstrong standing in front. The moon presents unique lighting: due to no atmosphere the light acts brightly and uniformly from a point source. This luminsosity was captured by keeping the astronaut quite dark whilst liberally adding white edge lighting, combined with white pencil for glare. It was exciting to interpret the bright golds and deep blood reds of the foil. I began with coloured fineliner outline, then filled in with gouache paint. </p>
