            <h1>Pantoran Taxi</h1>
            <p>This is a gouache response to some of the scenes in the Star Wars TV show "The Bad Batch" (S1E5). Pantora (the location) is quite obviously derived from a motif of Russia in particular elements of the architecture surrounding the Red Square in Moscow; especially the coloured Orthodox Christian onion-dome shapes whos patterns owe themselves to The Cathedral of St. Basil the Blessed. This was a particularly interesting painting subject due to the variety of colours and glowing feeling. An overlay of white pencil mimics the glow of bright headlights.</p>
