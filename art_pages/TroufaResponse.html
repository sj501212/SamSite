            <h1>Shipping Spill</h1>
            <p>This was a piece of art done in Adobe Illustrator in response to the work by Mary Iverson. It was one of the last pieces of work I did during my art A-level before school closed due to the pandemic. Iverson's work is meant to be a commentry on the pollutive nature of the shipping industry, where the juxtoposition of styles mimics the contrast between pristine natural environment and dirty man-made ships. </p>
